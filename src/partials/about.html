	<h3>About GitLens</h3>
	<p>
		GitLens started way back in mid-2016, when I fell in love with
		<a title="Learn more about Visual Studio Code" href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank"
			>Visual Studio Code</a
		>
		and wanted to play with the then newly released extension support. It was also a good excuse for me to improve
		my budding
		<a title="Learn more about TypeScript" href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>
		skills. It all started with a simple question &mdash; could I add Git insights via
		<i>code lens</i> to any document.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since then, GitLens has quickly grown from a simple prototype to a feature-rich product with millions of users
		and a mission of its own &mdash; to simply help you
		<b>better understand code</b>.
